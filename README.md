The sheer size of Cornell's campus definitely facilitates a variety of events to go to - if you can find them. Since so many events are available, it's often difficult to know what's happening on any given day. CUCelebrate is the solution to this problem, allowing anyone to know exactly what's going on at Cornell - let's CUCelebrate!

Using data scraped from the Cornell Events website, the backend team member created a database that is accessed by the app. The iOS team worked on the UI, as well as creating our own design theme. There is a list of featured events from the Cornell Events website and another list of events that are favorited by the user. On clicking each event, we get a detail view which has more information about the event as well as a button that can be pressed in order to see the event's location on Google Maps.
